This project took me about 3 mounths to get started I was going thru some bad mental health and it took me about that long to get myself to a psychiatrist and they diagnosed me with ADHD 
upon getting the meds I saw a almost immediate to do the work I have been trying to get myself to do for so long after all this when I started working on it it took me about 30h-40h to complete

I have to admit i did use a bit of chatGBT to get some of this code working but when I would use that I would spent some time learning exactly what the code it gave me was doing before moving on 
that is why you see a lot of comments.

Give me the best feed back you can if you have the time I would love for you to tear this code apart and let me know exactly what I did right and wrong and what best practices I could have benefited from useing. 
I am greatful for any feedback you have!
